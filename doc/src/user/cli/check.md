# The Check Command
Currently, there are two subcommands available.

## Runtime
As the name says, the checks are on the runtime level.

There are three shared options:
- `--chain <NAME>`The chain name, which will supply to the executable.
- `--executable <PATH>` The executable path.
- `--live <URI>` The live chain's RPC HTTP endpoint.

And there are two properties to check, `storage` and `version`.

### Examples
For convenience, I use the [Pangolin Network](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia-common) to demonstrate.

- `pangolin-dev` is the dev chain spec, which means its genesis is built from the latest code.
  If you are on Polkadot, then use `polkadot-dev`.
- `./drml` is the path to my local pangolin node executable.
- `https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network` is the Pangoro live chain's RPC HTTP endpoint.
  Note that, I use the Pangoro here. Just because I'm doing a demonstration.
  Compare with two different chains' runtime storage/version will get a lot of output.

#### Check Runtime Storage
```sh
subalfred check runtime --chain pangolin-dev --executable ./drml --live https://pangoro-rpc.darwinia.network --property storage
```

#### Check Runtime Version
```sh
subalfred check runtime --chain pangolin-dev --executable ./drml --live https://pangoro-rpc.darwinia.network --property version
```
```diff
RuntimeVersion {
-   spec_name: "Pangoro",
+   spec_name: "Pangolin",
-   impl_name: "Pangoro",
+   impl_name: "Pangolin",
    authoring_version: 0,
    spec_version: 29020,
    impl_version: 0,
    transaction_version: 0,
}
```

## Features
You could check if all your runtime features' were enabled correctly in one command.

### Episode 1
As we know Substrate has two runtime ENVs, native and WASM.

If a runtime dependency is not pure no-std, we need to write:
```toml
[features]
std = ["xxx/std"]

[dependencies]
xxx = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```

Sometimes, we might forget to write add the `xxx/std`.

Recently, I found someone have the same [requirement](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11715).

So, I decide to make this public.

### Episode 2
As time passed, more and more features were added to Substrate.

We have `std`, `runtime-benchmarks` and `try-runtime` now.

It's hard to check if all features are enabled correctly.

## CI
Moreover, we can add the checks into your project CI.

I've already add these to the [Darwinia CI](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia/blob/v0.12.3/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
And here is a real world [example](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia/pull/940#issuecomment-1226917895).
